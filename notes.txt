Creating a server offers users a different way to interact with your applications
instead of needing to run commands from the terminal to interact with your app

We can serve a website or we could serve up an http json based api
You can serve a static website or create a complex Http json based api to serve as the backend for something like a mobile or web application


A callback is a function we provide to another function as an argument with the intention of having it called later on
forEach and filter use callback pattern but are not asynchronous

Handlebars -> allows for rendering dynamic content -> we're able to set up templates which are similar to html documents but we can inject specific values inside

Methods are defined directly on an object



Data validation -> allow only ages greater than 18
Data sanitization -> Alter data before saving it -> Remove empty spaces around user's name
